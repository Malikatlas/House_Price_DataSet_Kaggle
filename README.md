# House_Price_DataSet_Kaggle
This project analyzes house prices using a dataset of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, containing 79 features related to structure, location, and property characteristics.The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with the complete analysis and a PDF report summarizing the findings and code outputs.
The goal is to identify key factors that influence housing prices by examining attributes such as basement height, square footage, neighborhood, and garage size. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling, this analysis provides insights into how different property features impact real estate values. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for data science research due to its comprehensive and modern real estate attributes.
